# rumbac - a simple flasher for _Arduino Nano 33 BLE / Sense_

`rumbac` is a simple commandline tool for uploading .bin files with compiled
programs to the _Arduino Nano 33 BLE_ or _... Sense_ board
(with the _nRF52840_ microcontroller).

The boards come preprogrammed with a builtin bootloader,
communicating over a serial port over USB.
The protocol used for that is a very simple, text-based one, called "SAM-BA".
`rumbac` implements a very minimal subset of that protocol,
just enough to allow flashing a .bin file to one of those supported boards.
The implementation is based on a popular `bossac` tool,
in a variant forked by the Arduino team for the _Nano_ board.

To install the tool, run:

    cargo install --git https://github.com/akavel/rumbac

An example usage session then looks like below:

_Remember to first double-press the button on the device
such that the LED will start pulsating._

```
C:> rumbac
Found 1 serial port:
 "COM13" = UsbPort(UsbPortInfo { vid: 9025, pid: 90, serial_number: Some("00000000000000007F65FDABFE86A5EB"), manufacturer: Some("Microsoft"), product: Some("UrzÄ…dzenie szeregowe USB (COM13)") })

C:> rumbac COM13

> Y00000000,0#
< "Y\n\r"
> Y00000000,00001000#
< "Y\n\r"
> K#
```

_The device should now automatically disconnect and start running
the newly flashed program._
